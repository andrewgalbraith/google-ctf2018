### OCR is cool! / MISC / Foobanizer9000

Flag: `CTF{caesarcipherisasubstitutioncipher}`

> Caesar once said, don't stab meâ€¦ but taking a screenshot of an image sure feels like being stabbed. You connected to a VNC server on the Foobanizer 9000, it was view only. This screenshot is all that was present but it's gibberish. Can you recover the original text?

The attached ZIP archive contains a screenshot:

Within this email something catches my eye. I see the `xxx{....}` makeup of a flag in:

But what is that `VMY`? Based on earlier CTF experience I do a quick count of letter distance of `VMY` and `CTF`. Both have 17 and 12. So it looks like ROT encoding.

```
>>> o = [ord(x) for x in 'VMY']
>>> (o[1]-o[0])%26, (o[2]-o[1])%26
(17, 12)
>>> o = [ord(x) for x in 'CTF']
>>> (o[1]-o[0])%26, (o[2]-o[1])%26
(17, 12)
```

At this point we could use an online tool like [https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher) to bruteforce it. But let's take the hard route and figure out the correct number of rotations by looking at the distance between `V` and `C`:

```
>>> ord('V')-ord('C')
19
```

So now we know its ROT19 encoding. Again we could use an online decoder, but we won't. Let's build our own bruteforcer:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
from string import ascii_lowercase as lc, ascii_uppercase as uc

def rot_alpha(n):
    lookup = str.maketrans(lc + uc, lc[n:] + lc[:n] + uc[n:] + uc[:n])
    return lambda s: s.translate(lookup)

for x in range(1, 26):
    res = rot_alpha(x)(sys.argv[1])
    print(26-x, res)
```

Let's run it and find the flag:

```
